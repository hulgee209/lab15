# Conflict Resolution

When a merge conflict occurs during pull request merging, the steps to resolve it are:

1. Identify the conflicting files.
2. Fetch and merge the latest changes from the target branch (develop/main).
3. Manually resolve the conflicts in the code.
4. Test the application to ensure the resolution did not break anything.
5. Stage, commit, and push the resolved changes.

Tools used: Git CLI, GitHub Web UI, VS Code.
